This project analyzes the Netflix dataset using PostgreSQL to find the top 10 actors whoâ€™ve appeared in the most Indian-produced movies. It uses UNNEST(), STRING_TO_ARRAY(), and TRIM() to clean and split cast data, then aggregates results with a CTE for clarity. A great example of practical SQL for entertainment data analysis.
