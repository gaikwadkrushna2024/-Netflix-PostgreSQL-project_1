This project analyzes the Netflix dataset using PostgreSQL to find the top 10 actors whoâ€™ve appeared in the most Indian-produced movies. It uses UNNEST(), STRING_TO_ARRAY(), and TRIM() to clean and split cast data, then aggregates results with a CTE for clarity. A great example of practical SQL for entertainment data analysis.
## Objective
To analyze the Netflix dataset using PostgreSQL and identify the top 10 actors who have appeared in the most movies produced in India. This project demonstrates practical SQL techniques for handling multi-value fields, cleaning text data, and performing aggregation using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
## Schema
CREATE TABLE netflis
(
	show_id	VARCHAR(5),
	type    VARCHAR(10),
	title	VARCHAR(250),
	director VARCHAR(550),
	casts	VARCHAR(1050),
	country	VARCHAR(550),
	date_added	VARCHAR(55),
	release_year	INT,
	rating	VARCHAR(15),
	duration	VARCHAR(15),
	listed_in	VARCHAR(250),
	description VARCHAR(550)
);

SELECT * FROM netflis;

## Business Problems and Solutions

WITH lll AS (
  SELECT 
    TRIM(unnest(string_to_array(country, ','))) AS country_1,
    release_year,
    COUNT(*) AS re
  FROM netflis
  GROUP BY 1, 2

SELECT 
  release_year,
  SUM(re) AS total_releases,
  ROUND(AVG(re)::numeric, 2) AS avg_releases_per_year
FROM lll
WHERE country_1 = 'India'
GROUP BY release_year
ORDER BY release_year desc



### 12. List All Movies that are Documentaries

)select * from ttt
where list = 'Documentaries'

### or 
SELECT list,
       COUNT(*) AS total
FROM (
  SELECT TRIM(unnest(string_to_array(listeds_in, ','))) AS list
